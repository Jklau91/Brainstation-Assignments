For this challenge, I used line 2 and 3 to state the variables that I am going to use. 
Moving forward, I used a for loop to complete the triangle. I started the equation "Start=Start+Hash". 
By doing so, the first line will be "#" and adding an additional one for next line. This process is 
repeated 7 times.
